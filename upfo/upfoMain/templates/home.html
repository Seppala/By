			<p>It's not easy enough to bump into friends. Even if you live close, you lose touch with some friends. We want to change that. That's why we create By. It's the easiest way to tell your friends you're up for something.</p>

			<h2 class="lightblue">By?</h2>
			<p>By means village in Swedish. Back when most of us lived is smaller villages, it was easy to connect with people. You pretty much knew everyone. We want to bring some of that magic back.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="span4">
			<h2 class="lightblue">What does By do?</h2>
			<p>Basically By's just one button - The "I'm up for something button". You click the button and your Facebook friends who are also on By can immediately see that you're up for something. So check out who's up for something and give them a call. It's very early days for By, we're developing it every day. We'd love to hear your feedback as well, you can contact us easily by email at riku - at - seppa.la </p>
