			<h2 class="gray">By? Epic?</h2>
			<p>By means village in Swedish. Back when most of us lived is smaller villages, it was easy to connect with people. You pretty much knew everyone. We want to bring some of that to the cities we live in now. It's Epic.</p>

			<h2 class="gray">What does By do?</h2>
			<p>Basically By is just a button from which you can tell your friends that you're up for something. You just log in with Facebook and click the "I'm up for something"-button. You'll see the friends that are up for something and they'll see you. Then all you have to do is call them up!</p>
