			<h2 class="gray">Meet more friends</h2>
			<p>We're here to push people away from their screens. Shut down your computer, turn the TV off and go meet people. Your close friends. Long-lost acquaintances. We wanted more interaction with the real people that have been important to us, that's why we created By. </p>

			<h2 class="gray">By? Epic?</h2>
			<p>By means village in Swedish. Back when most of us lived is smaller villages, it was easy to connect with people. You pretty much knew everyone. We want to bring some of that to the cities we live in now. We think it's Epic.</p>

		<div class="span4 margin49">
			<h2 class="gray">What does By do?</h2>
			<p>Basically By is just a button from which you can tell your friends that you're up for something. You just log in with Facebook and click the "I'm up for something"-button. You'll see the friends that are up for something and they'll see you. Then all you have to do is call them up!</p>
