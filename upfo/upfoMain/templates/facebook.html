		<p><i>Have you ever wanted to do something but you didn't know who to call?</i></p>
		<p>We think it's super important that we meet our friends often, and even meet friends we haven't seen for a while.</p>
		<p style="margin-top:-5px"> That's what we're doing with Byy. It's the easiest way to meet your friends more often and even meet friends you haven't met for a while.</p>		
	<h3 style="margin-top:25px" class="gray">How does it work?</h3>
	<p>You just log in with Facebook and click the "I'm up for something"-button. You'll see the friends that are up for something and they'll see you.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom:25px">Byy is optimized for mobile, but you can use it in your browser as well.</p>
