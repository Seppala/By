		<p>We're here to push people away from their screens. Shut down your computer, turn the TV off and go meet people. Your close friends. Long-lost acquaintances. We wanted more interaction with the real people that have been important to us, that's why we created By.  </p>
		<p style="margin-top:-5px">It's the easiest way to meet more friends.</p>		
	<h3 style="margin-top:25px" class="gray">How does it work?</h3>
	<p>By is just a button from which you can tell your friends that you're up for something.</p>
	<p>You just log in with Facebook and click the "I'm up for something"-button. You'll see the friends that are up for something and they'll see you. Then all you have to do is call them up!</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom:25px">Byy is optimized for mobile, but you can use it in your browser as well. It's new and we're still developing it so please give us feedback!</p>
